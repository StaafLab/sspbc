Single-Sample Predictors for Breast Cancer

Single-Sample Predictors for Breast Cancer (sspbc) include functions and models to assign classes to breast cancer samples. It works on raw gene expression data.

The included single-sample predictor (SSP) models were developed using gene expression data from RNAseq generated using HiSat/StringTie. Detailed description on training and validation of the provided SSP models is available in the manuscript by Staaf J. et al. medRxiv 2021.12.03.21267116 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.03.21267116). Training was performed using the previously described AIMS method from Paquet and Hallett (2014) J Natl Cancer Inst 107(1):357 using scripts available from the AIMS GitHub repository (https://github.com/meoyo/AIMS).

Description on how to use sspbc with examples and testdata is provided with the R package.
